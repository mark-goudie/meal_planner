- Add a favourites feature

Recommended Next Steps
Implement User Authentication: Introduce user login and registration functionalities to manage user-specific data securely.

Enhance Form Validation: Improve form validation to provide users with immediate feedback on input errors.

Develop Testing Suite: Begin writing unit and integration tests to ensure the reliability of your application as it grows.

Improve Documentation: Update the README and add inline comments to make the codebase more accessible to other developers.

Plan for Future Features: Outline a roadmap for upcoming features like meal plan weekly views, shopping list generators, and recipe importers to guide development priorities.

1. üóìÔ∏è Meal Plan Weekly View (Calendar-style UI)
   Let users view a 7-day week plan grid

Display each day‚Äôs meal(s)

Could even include breakfast/lunch/dinner sections

2. üõí Shopping List Generator
   Select multiple recipes or entire week

Extract and combine ingredient lists

Display or export list

3. üßë‚Äçüç≥ Recipe Importer
   Paste a recipe URL or copied text ‚Üí parse and populate a form

Could be GPT-enhanced or rules-based

4. üë• User Accounts (Multi-user support)
   Login/logout for different users

Separate recipe books or meal plans per user

1. Printable & Exportable Shopping List
   Print Button: Add a button to print the shopping list (window.print()).
   Export: Allow users to export the list as a PDF or CSV.
2. Persistent Shopping List
   Session Storage: Save the shopping list in the browser‚Äôs local/session storage so it persists on reload.
   User Accounts: Allow logged-in users to save and manage multiple shopping lists.
3. Ingredient Grouping & Quantity Summing
   Smart Parsing: Parse and group similar ingredients (e.g., sum up "2 eggs" and "3 eggs" to "5 eggs").
   Categories: Group items by type (produce, dairy, pantry, etc.) for easier shopping.
4. Meal Plan Integration
   Shopping List from Meal Plan: Allow users to generate a shopping list directly from their meal plan for a selected week or date range.
5. Mobile-Friendly UI
   Ensure all forms, lists, and buttons are touch-friendly and responsive for mobile users.
6. Ingredient Check-off
   Allow users to check off items as they shop (toggle a strikethrough or fade-out effect).
7. Recipe Scaling
   Let users scale recipes (e.g., double or halve) and update the shopping list quantities accordingly.
8. Favorites & Ratings
   Let users mark favorite recipes and rate them, then filter by favorites or top-rated.
9. AI Suggestions
   Suggest recipes based on what‚Äôs already in the shopping list or pantry.
10. Accessibility Improvements
    Ensure color contrast, keyboard navigation, and ARIA labels for all interactive elements.
    If you want code examples or implementation details for any of these, just ask!
